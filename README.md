## 351Noir 351ELEC Theme

**All credits for MonsieurDaz!!** i only added missing themes as he don't have time and give me green light for doing it :)


This is a modern **horizontal** theme based on [Epic Noir](https://github.com/c64-dev/es-theme-epicnoir), that matches the 351ELEC black/white/red aesthetic and the RG351P handheld's resolution and aspect ratio.

### Installation and Updating

**The preferred method of installation is through the Theme Downloader in EmulationStation's main menu**

However, you can also install the theme manually by following these instructions:
1. Download the .zip file from the [Releases section](https://github.com/MonsieurDaz/es-theme-351noir/releases) and extract it.
2. Copy the es-theme-351noir folder to `~/.config/emulationstation/themes` in the ext4 partition of 351ELEC.

...But really, download it through the theme downloader/updater.

### Theme Notes

This theme supports video. You can also use a scraped image in conjunction with the video. If you scrape both, when a game is selected, it will show the screenshot for a couple of seconds before fading and playing the video.

Game screenshots are not included within the theme. You can scrape your own - you should use game boxart/screenshots and/or videos.
